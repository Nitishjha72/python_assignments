Answer 8:
	100 is invalid because it will create confusion whether we are trying to use actual 100 (integer) or the variable 100 which we have created.
	a = a+100 (Here it will create conflict whether its a variable or integer)
	
Answer 9: int() will be used to get integer version of a value
		  str() will be used to get string version of a value
		  float() will be used to get float version of a value
		  
Answer 10:
		'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'  This will throw error because only string can be concatenated to a string but 99 is an integer.
		We can convert 99 to string and then concatenate. 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
